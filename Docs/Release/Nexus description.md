## Short

Help Fargoth by standing up to Hrisskar!

## Full

I've always been frustrated that the quest Fargoth's Hiding Place has no way to let Fargoth know that
Hrisskar is getting others to do his dirty work. Now you can stand up for your best friend in Vvardenfell!

Extends the vanilla quest Fargoth's Hiding Place with two routes through it:
1. Insulting and taunting Hrisskar into a fight when he first asks you to find Fargoth's hiding place.
2. Going to Fargoth with the information after you agree to Hrisskar's ask.

## Incompatibilities

The following mods also make changes to the Fargoth's Hiding Place quest:

* Fargoth in Distress by AliceL93 and PoodleSandwich2 
* Choice and Consquence - Fargoth by Drockman64

I made this mod not knowing these two already existed. They both look pretty good, so if my one doesn't suit
then one of these two likely will.
