Description
============
Help Fargoth by standing up to Hrisskar!

I've always been frustrated that the quest Fargoth's Hiding Place has no way to let Fargoth know that
Hrisskar is getting others to do his dirty work. Now you can stand up for your best friend in Vvardenfell!

Extends the vanilla quest Fargoth's Hiding Place with two routes through it:
1. Insulting and taunting Hrisskar into a fight when he first asks you to find Fargoth's hiding place.
2. Going to Fargoth with the information after you agree to Hrisskar's ask.

Permissions
============
Modify my mod, but credit me as the original creator

=============
Installation
=============
To install, just extract into the Morrowind/Data Files directory.
Then start the Morrowind Launcher, go to Data Files, and make sure your choice is checked to activate.

If using Vortex or MO, then do as you normally would.

Removal
========
To uninstall, start the Morrowind Launcher, go to Data Files, uncheck the plugin.
Then delete Old Ebonheart Apartment.esp from the Morrowind/Data Files directory.

==================
Incompatibilities
==================
The following mods also make changes to the Fargoth's Hiding Place quest:

* Fargoth in Distress by AliceL93 and PoodleSandwich2 
* Choice and Consquence - Fargoth by Drockman64

I made this mod not knowing these two already existed. They both look pretty good, so if my one doesn't suit
then one of these two likely will.

Known Issues or Bugs
=====================
No known issues or bugs at this point.
